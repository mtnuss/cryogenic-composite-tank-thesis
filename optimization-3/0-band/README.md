# 0-Band Optimization

This folder contains simulations for the 0-band layup of the cryogenic composite tank. The 0-band is a novel approach to reinforing the tank walls explored in the thesis.
Subfolders include:

- **maxstrain/** – Maximum strain criterion
- **stress/** – Stress-based evaluation
- **tsaiwu/** – Tsai-Wu composite failure criterion

Each includes:
- `model.hm` – HyperMesh model
- `run.fem` – Solver deck
- `output.out` – Text output
- `images/` – Mesh and contour plots

`.h3d` results removed due to GitHub file size limits.
