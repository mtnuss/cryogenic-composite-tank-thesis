# Benchmark Industry Quasi-Isotropic Approach

This folder contains the benchmark model files used for reference and comparison throughout the optimization of a cryogenic composite LH₂ tank structure. All model files, input decks, and visualization data represent a conventional or preliminary structural design without advanced laminate optimization. This follows the standard composite cryogenic tank used in industry for rocket propulsion. 

## 📁 Contents

- **Model files** – Finite element models used for structural and thermal analysis.
- **Plots and figures** – Stress distributions, failure index maps, and mesh configurations.

## 📌 Purpose

The benchmark model serves as a **baseline for comparison** against optimized laminate designs developed in subsequent steps. It represents a structurally viable tank layout before applying multi-step failure and mass optimization algorithms.

## 🛠️ Software Used

- Altair HyperWorks / OptiStruct
- HyperMesh for meshing and setup

## 📄 Notes

- The model assumes a factor of safety of 1.5.
- Thermal properties are included to simulate cryogenic LH₂ conditions.
- All files comply with the directory structure used throughout the thesis.
